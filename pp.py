ere is an example of how you might build a sample app to track NumerAI payouts for a portfolio of models in real-time using Python, and allow users to check their contributions to their portfolio in a portal:

import requests
import time

# Set API endpoint URL and API key
api_endpoint = "https://api.numer.ai/payouts"
api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Set headers for the request
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}"
}

# Set interval for payout checks (in seconds)
interval = 60

while True:
    # Make GET request to retrieve list of payouts
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)

    # Check the response status code
    if response.status_code == 200:
        payouts = response.json()

        # Print payouts for each model
        for payout in payouts:
            print(f"Model {payout['model_name']}: ${payout['amount']}")

        # Print total payout for portfolio
        total_payout = sum([payout['amount'] for payout in payouts])
        print(f"Total payout: ${total_payout}")
    else:
        print("Error retrieving payouts")
        print(response.status_code)
        print(response.text)

    # Sleep for the specified interval before checking payouts again
    time.sleep(interval)

To allow users to check their contributions to their portfolio in a portal, you might consider implementing a login system to authenticate users and track their portfolio models. You could then create a page or endpoint that displays the payouts for each model in the user's portfolio, as well as the total payout for the portfolio.

For example, you might create a /portal endpoint that displays the payouts for the user's portfolio when accessed with a GET request. The endpoint could use the NumerAI API to retrieve the payouts for the user's portfolio models and display them on the page.

@app.route('/portal')
def portal():
    # Retrieve payouts for user's portfolio models
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint, headers=headers)
    payouts = response.json()

    # Render template with payouts
    return render_template('portal.html', payouts=payouts)

In the template portal.html, you could display the payouts for each model in the user's portfolio using a loop, as well as the total payout for the portfolio:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Model</th>
    <th>Payout</th>
  </tr>
  {% for payout in payouts %}
  <tr>
    <td>{{ payout['model_name'] }}</td>
    <td>${{ payout['amount'] }}</td>
  </tr>
  {% endfor %}
  <tr>
    <td>Total</td>
    <td>${{ payouts|sum(attribute='amount') }}</td>
  </tr>
</table>
